## Sound Law Rules

It may be a bit biased to say this is English, it should be said that it is Indo-European language, including Latin, German, Greek, etc., which are all related. The words extended are basically the same source, but sound differently due to region, time and other relationships.

### Vowel Law

- `The positions of a, e, i, o, u five vowels are interchangeable` (For example, sing, sang, snog, sung)
- `The positions of a, e, i, o, u + y, w semi-vowels are interchangeable`
