authorsWords: When we want to start learning new things or pursue our dreams, we often feel like we don't know where to start, or hesitate because of our lack of ability. But in fact, the important thing is to dare to take the first step, even if your current level is not high enough. Because only by taking action can you have the opportunity to gradually hone your abilities and grow continuously in the process of learning and practice. I realized four truths from my previous experience.

## Don't label yourself

1. First Story:
   During a summer vacation in college, I participated in a camp organized by the Institute for Information Industry at National Taiwan University. I remember when I first arrived, after hearing my team members introduce themselves on the first day, everyone was from top universities. I almost didn't go the second day. Fortunately, I persisted in the end, and even bravely explained my ideas during the topic discussion. Even though I spoke brokenly, everyone listened carefully and gave immediate feedback. So we shouldn't always assume that others will magnify our shortcomings with bad eyes. People actually don't care much about our background, but whether what we say has substance.

2. Second Story:
   When I took the academic ability test, I only got a low standard level 4 in math. Everyone who knew me since high school knew that my math was really bad. So although I was in the natural science group, I ended up studying liberal arts. After participating in the camp mentioned above, I slowly came into contact with some analysis methods, and applied these methods to myself. I started to want to know what the IT industry was doing, so I decided to take courses in the Computer Science department. I surprisingly passed Linear Algebra, although barely passing. But this made me realize that no matter how bad my ability is, it doesn't mean I can't achieve what I want to accomplish. BTW, actually 80% of Web Dev doesn't require complex math, but lies in the ability and logic to break down problems.

## As long as you start, there will be opportunities

After I started searching for how to teach myself to become an engineer, I didn't expect even FB ads to come to help me, pushing me the registration link for the free summer front-end college camp of LiuX Academy. Assuming I hadn't started searching for this information today, the algorithm wouldn't have automatically recommended relevant information to me, and I might have missed this stepping stone.

Because I have envied others for having straight teeth for a long time, recently just ended my life in the south, and immediately rushed to get braces after returning to Taipei. Not long after, I also felt very deeply~

## Seize the opportunity, keep a normal heart, persist

After entering the front-end college camp, my plan was originally to get the reward for the top three after the camp ended - becoming a teaching assistant (free courses, and remote part-time job). But even though I really worked hard, I still failed to get into the top three, but I was in the top ten. After the camp ended, I continued to study on my own. After half a year, I surprisingly received a notification for a teaching assistant opportunity, but the premise was to submit a front-end Side Project within the deadline. Fortunately, I didn't give up at the beginning, I made it immediately, and successfully won the opportunity.

## Recognize specific facts, stop losses in time

Sometimes, without comprehensive analysis, rushing forward immediately makes it easy to hit a wall. At this time, if you still don't know the importance of stopping losses, or even want to persist in a losing position, you are really paying tuition for yourself. This taught me that sometimes rushing is a good thing, but comprehensive analysis and stopping losses are really important!

Before when BTC was 60000, I didn't do much homework, feeling that rushing was the way to go. Unexpectedly, right after rushing in, it dropped huge. At this time, actually stopping loss was still in time, but unfortunately I just held on, and in the end, the position was directly liquidated...

Sometimes, we are bound by our own shortcomings, thinking that we must reach a certain level before we are qualified to try new things. But this idea is actually a misconception. Because only through actual action can we gradually hone our skills and experience, and grow continuously in this process. Only by daring to start can we have the opportunity to move towards higher goals.

Do you also have similar experiences or things you have been hesitating for a long time without taking action?
