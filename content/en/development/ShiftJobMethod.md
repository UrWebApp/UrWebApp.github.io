Although the profession I finally switched to is a software engineer, after my own practice and research, I believe this set of methods can actually be applied to most industries, not limited to engineers, so I want to share it with everyone.

## Ask Why First

When you are tired of searching for how to change jobs, have you thought about or remembered why you want to change jobs?
Before planning how to change jobs, ask yourself properly why you want to change jobs. Here you can refer to the book "[Start with Why](https://www.books.com.tw/products/E050028575?sloc=main)", we will borrow the author's **Golden Circle Rule**.

### Huh, Golden Circle Rule?

The Golden Circle Rule is a business theory that describes how to clearly express an idea or product to make it attractive to potential customers. The Golden Circle Rule consists of three concentric circles, from inside out are: Why do you want to do it (**Reason**), What do you want to do (**Goal**), How to do it (**Method**). The structure seems simple, but it is completely consistent with how the human brain processes information and emotions. However, **the core "Why" is the part most difficult to express clearly in language, and also the part most easily overlooked by people**.

We often misunderstand that what to do is the Key Point, but actually why we want to do it is the Key Point, because this is what is most difficult to replace, while there can be many choices for what to do. You can try to use the structure in the figure below to examine whether you really decided to switch tracks for some reason.

## Make Good Use of Reverse Mind Map, Cause from Effect

### Quantity of Golden Circles

After we understand what the Golden Circle Rule is, when inferring the reasons for our job transition, we should be able to draw more than one golden circle. If not many golden circles are drawn, it may also mean that there is not much attraction or motivation for the job transition. Conversely, the more golden circles there are, the more it can show the desire for job transition.

### Combine with Reverse Mind Map

After having multiple golden circles, you should be able to discover that the Key Point (Why) for achieving the golden circle can derive **common solutions**, and there may be more than one solution. At this time, we can analyze which solution connects to the most golden circles. This solution may also be our **final choice**.

Why do I say it might be the final choice, rather than the best choice?
Because what is analyzed here is to confirm that we really want to change jobs, and what profession to switch to. Cost considerations have not yet been carried out, and it is also possible to encounter the situation in the figure below, where the solutions of the golden circles are all different. In this case, we have to make a choice from other aspects.

<!-- For example, if you want to promote a new mobile phone to people, you can say first: "Our goal is to provide you with a super thin, super fast mobile phone." Then you can say: "The reason we do this is because we believe people should have a beautifully designed, high-performance mobile phone that allows them to be more efficient in life and work." Finally, you can say: "We achieved this goal by using the most advanced technology and materials, as well as a rigorously tested manufacturing process." This is a simple example of the Golden Circle Rule.

## Think about Design First, Then Take Action

Observing many successful job transition articles, you will find one point, that is, most authors will say that you will only know after trying. But is it survivor bias? The answer is also that you will only know after trying, so how to design a verification action with high CP value is very important.

### Odyssey Plan

Here we refer to the book "Designing Your Life". There are many concepts in the book, such as mind maps, etc., and here we are going to use the **Odyssey Plan**. The Odyssey Plan is to come up with several different life templates for the next five years.

In the previous section, different solutions have been filtered out using the Golden Circle Rule and Reverse Mind Map. Now, we need to apply these solutions to the Odyssey Plan, use these solutions to derive their respective life templates to analyze the pros and cons. Of course, the first template is derived from the current profession.

In each template, it must include:

1. A visual/graphic timeline, anything related to work can be put on it, including lifestyle.
2. Write down potential problems, these problems are actually potential costs.
3. Evaluate a few things on the dashboard: Resources, Likability, Confidence, Coherence (Does it coordinate with work view and life view? It might also be the "Why" obtained in the Golden Circle just now)

### Verify Prototype Design

In engineering design, **Prototype Design** is often mentioned. Here it refers to designing a template with several key functions or features before launching the product to verify whether the product is feasible.

After planning templates using the Odyssey Plan, several prototypes are obtained. In life design, the ways to verify these prototypes are mostly:

1. **Design Interview**: Interview/Consult some people who have relevant experience or are doing what you want to do, and get the answers you want through the questions you designed.
2. **Design Experience**: Go directly to relevant industries for internships or participate in camps for relevant knowledge, to verify whether you are suitable through short-term immersive experience/learning.

## Summary

### Learn from Design Thinking, Lean Startup and Agile Development.

1. **Lean Startup**: It is to avoid large amount of capital required for early planning, expensive product listing, and failure by integrating "experimentally verifying business assumptions" and "quickly updating and iterating products".
2. **Agile Development**: It is a development method that focuses on continuously improving products in an iterative manner, verifying and improving designs through short-cycle trials.

When the above verification encounters failure, it may be that you find yourself unsuitable, or the transition cost is too high, etc. Don't be too discouraged, instead it is worth being happy, because stopping loss in time when not too much cost has been invested yet, not only reduces waste of money, but more importantly reduces the payment of time cost. In the limited time, verify the next prototype quickly, and constantly improve the prototype, to achieve job transition in the Minimum Viable way.
