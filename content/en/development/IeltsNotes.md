## [IELTS Preparation Order](https://www.douyin.com/video/7262565165500075283)

1. Understand relevant information on the IELTS official website: registration process, candidate instructions, registration time, scoring standards, exam content.
2. Evaluate your own English ability and do IELTS practice questions regularly.
   - Choose one set from Cambridge IELTS 11-15 for a simple test, doing only the 3 reading passages.
   - If you get 32 or more out of 40 correct, your foundation is very strong; 32-26 is average; below 25 is poor.
   - CET-4/CET-6 score conversion?
3. Determine the preparation duration (2-3 months).
   - CET-4 below 425: 6 months preparation - 3 months to build foundation, 3 months for exam prep.
   - CET-4 425-550: 4 months preparation - 1 month to build foundation, 3 months for exam prep.
   - CET-4 above 550: 3 months preparation.
   - CET-6 below 425: 3 months preparation - 1 month to build foundation, 2 months for exam prep.
   - CET-6 425-550: 2 months formal preparation.
   - CET-6 above 550: 1 month formal preparation.

## Grammar [English Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is7vn5URVcc&ab_channel=%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E5%85%94)

- In Taiwan, we interpret the Object as "Receiver"

```
                  => Predicate Verb => Simple Sentence (Sentence Components Subject/Verb/Object/Complement/Attributive/Adverbial/Appositive ...) Combination Compound Sentence/Complex Sentence
English Core => Verb      => Complex Sentence (Main Clause/Subordinate Clause) Clause (Verb, Noun, Pronoun, Article, Adjective, Numeral, Adverb, Preposition, Interjection, Conjunction)
                     => Indicate Time/State/Mood/Negative/Passive/Possibility/Obligation but need Auxiliary Verb

                  => Non-Predicate Verb => Modified Predicate Verb, can replace almost all clauses, simplify sentences
```

> Subject (who / person or thing) + Predicate (how / broad action, what happened)

- Core concept: How many objects does the verb in the predicate need to fully express the meaning

1. Subject + (Intransitive) Verb || No receiver needed

   Broad Action / Verb:

   `Completed independently` / Intransitive Verb => Dad Rabbit (sleeps)

2. Subject + (Transitive) Verb + Object || One receiver

   `Has "ONE" action receiver` => Dad Rabbit (likes)? => Dad Rabbit likes (you) Object

3. Subject + (Ditransitive) Verb + Direct Object + Indirect Object || Two receivers

   `Has "TWO" action receivers` => Dad Rabbit teaches (you) (English)

   Dad Rabbit teaches (English direct object)

   Dad Rabbit teaches (you indirect object)

   Dad Rabbit (teaches) (you) (English)

4. Subject + (Complex Transitive) Verb + Object + Object Complement || One receiver

   `Has "ONE" action receiver, but this action cannot form a meaningful sentence (Complex Transitive Verb)`

   Dad Rabbit "considers" you?

   Dad Rabbit "considers" you (smart / object complement)

5. Subject + (Link) Verb + Subject Complement/Predicative || Assign information

   Linking Verb

   is => Assigns the information of the following word to the preceding word

   Dad Rabbit "is" tall => Dad Rabbit = Tall

   Dad Rabbit "is in" the room => Dad Rabbit = In the room

   Dad Rabbit "(is/appears) looks" very tall => Dad Rabbit = Very tall

### Parts Of Speech

Simple Sentence => Cannot be split into more sentences

1. Subject
2. Predicate Verb
3. Object
4. Object Complement
5. Subject Complement / Predicative
6. Attributive: Modifies Subject or Object => (Little AT) Rabbit S ate PV (big AT) carrot O
7. Adverbial: Modifies Predicate Verb => Rabbit S (quickly AD) ate PV
8. Appositive: States the Subject or Object again => Dad Rabbit S, (an English teacher AP, equal status to Subject), ate PV carrot O

Simple Sentence Combination => Compound Sentence / Complex Sentence

> Complex Sentence => main clause + subordinate clause
> Subordinate clause replaces a Subject or Object in a simple sentence with another sentence. Noun Clause (Subject Clause/Object Clause/Subject Complement Clause/Appositive Clause), Attributive Clause, Adverbial Clause

### Parts of Speech (Word Classes)

Sentence composition is the same (Subject-Verb-Object), but composed of different word classes

1. Nouns: Indicate people and things => Proper Nouns / Common Nouns rabbit
2. Articles: Describe people and things => Dad Rabbit is "a" rabbit
3. Pronouns: Replace people and things => "I" am a rabbit
4. Adjectives: Describe people and things => I am a "smart" rabbit
5. Numerals: Indicate quantity => I ate "two" carrots
6. Adverbs: Modify actions or adjectives => I ate carrots "quickly"
7. Prepositions: Indicate relationship with other words => I ate carrots "with" chopsticks
8. Interjections: Express exclamation => "Ah", this carrot is delicious
9. Conjunctions: Connect words and sentences => "Because" I was hungry, I ate carrots "and" potatoes
10. Verbs

---

Sentence components and word classes are two different things

### Predicate Verb

Tense / Aspect / Mood

- Tense

1. Indicates the "Time" of the action => Present/Past/Future/"Calculated Future" from a past point (Future in the Past)
2. Indicates the "State" (Aspect) of the action => Unspecified (Simple)/Perfect/Continuous/Perfect Continuous (Continuous and ongoing)

4\*4 => 16 Tenses

3. Verb Mood => Indicates hypothesis/emotion of the action
   - Subjunctive Mood: Expresses wish/contrary to fact => If I "were" a rabbit => Implies I am actually not a rabbit
   - Indicative Mood: I "eat" carrots
   - Imperative Mood: "Eat" this carrot

> Predicate verbs cannot independently express negative/possibility/necessity etc...

### Auxiliary Verbs

> Disguised full verbs, or even other parts of speech =>
> can, might, must, do, have, be

Eat =>

Have eaten

Is eating

Is eaten

Can eat

Might eat

Must eat

Do not eat

### Non-Predicate Verbs

Verbs can act as Predicate Verbs, but also as Subject, Subject Complement, Attributive, Object, Adverbial, Object Complement, Appositive

Non-predicate verbs can replace all clauses, thereby simplifying sentences, but cannot express the time, state, voice, and mood of the action

- Infinitive: to eat (Same as base form)
- Present Participle: eating (Same as continuous)
- Gerund: eating (Same as continuous)
- Past Participle: eaten (Same as perfect)
